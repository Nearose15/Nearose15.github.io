		<h6> Let me tell you my life story </h6> 
		<p> Once apon a time I was a a little girl, running round in pink skirts because those were the only things I would wear.</p>  
		<P> I also said no to everything because I was a very negetive person and I hadn't connected to my spirit.
		<p> I'll skip the next 10 years because they're boring and i'll tell about what happened to me on monday night, 11th of September 2017.  
		<p> It was just after 7, the night was cold but I wasn't far from the warmth of home. The faultly back wheel of my brothers scooter scraped along the ground as I smelt the aromas of peoples dinner wafting out their windows. </p>
		<p> Mum was making salmon salad for dinner, and I was desperate to get home, not only for that but I really needed to pee. I started scootering faster and faster. The scooter rattled along the uneven concrete, my eyes straining into the darkness to make sure I didn't crash.</p>    
		<p> Then suddenly my body was flung forward, arms outstreched, as the scooter hit a small rock. I crashed onto the ground, my hands and arms scraping across the concrete. The scooter came down after me, hitting and grazing the back of my legs. I stifled a cry and looked up.</p>
		<p> Through tears leaking out of my eyes I saw two people walking ahead of me. I quickly got up and hoped they hadn't heard my fall. Then I headed home, my hands dirty and bloodly. I still have scars to this day of that truamatizing experience.</p> 
		<h6> And that's what happened to me on monday the 11th of September, 2017. </h6>
